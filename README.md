# Ender 5 Plus Config Files

NO WARRANTIES! Please use this as a reference, do not just plainly copy and paste these configs into your machine. Review, understand and think first.

Please note, all stl's credit due to the folks who made them. I will update this with links to the printable pages once I re-find them. 

## Printer.cfg
Customized for the Ender 5 Plus running a Sprite Pro, with the v4.2.7 Silent Board. 

Note, for the Z Axis you'll need a Z Axis Splitter such as https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TCYGTXT?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details

## Filament Guide

I ended up Supergluing the bowden tube into this, this allowed me to keep the stock position of the spool holder and filament sensor. 

## Carriage Plate 

This Carriage plate does not require you to cut the triangle 'ear' off the sprite mounting bracket, but you do lose about 10 steps off the X and Y, this is reflected in the printer.cfg in the X stepper and Y stepper config. 

## Cable Management Box

I hate wires, so I printed this to clean that up
